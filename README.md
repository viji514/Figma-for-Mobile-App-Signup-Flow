# Figma for Mobile App Signup Flow

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for designing the signup flow of our mobile application using Figma. It includes design files, assets, and documentation to facilitate the design process.

## Overview

Figma is a powerful collaborative interface design tool that enables designers and developers to create, iterate, and share design prototypes in real-time. The signup flow design is a critical aspect of our mobile app, and Figma provides the necessary tools and features to streamline the design process and ensure a seamless user experience.

## Features

- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Multiple team members can collaborate on the signup flow design simultaneously, allowing for faster iteration and feedback loops.
  
- **Component-Based Design**: Figma's component-based design system enables designers to create reusable UI elements, ensuring consistency and efficiency across the signup flow screens.

- **Prototyping**: Designers can create interactive prototypes of the signup flow to simulate user interactions and validate design decisions before implementation.

- **Version History**: Figma maintains a version history of design files, allowing team members to track changes, revert to previous versions, and maintain design integrity.

## Getting Started

To begin using Figma for designing the mobile app signup flow, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
